# CVUL 3D Engine
### A small Vulkan based 3D game engine

First of all, I need to explicitly state that this project is pretty much entirely based on the repo made by @travisvroman over here. Please check them out! I first saw his project, and then got inspired for this. If you look close, I'm planning on just reading how everything compiles to get a didactic overview - so it's not much different as just a plain fork of his project. I will not take the design of this project as my own!

Feature set as of last commit:
- Logging capabilites (Fatal error, error, warn, info, debug and trace messages)
- Basic assertion capabilities
- Platform standardization (windows has been the only implementation so far)
- Application layer code for user friendliness


Please give credits to the respectful creator [of the project!](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi)
