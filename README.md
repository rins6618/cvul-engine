# CVUL 3D Engine
### A small Vulkan based 3D game engine

I first saw the kohi project, inspiring me for this. I do indeed want to follow the steps of kohi, mainly due to learning.

Feature set as of last commit:
- Logging capabilites (Fatal error, error, warn, info, debug and trace messages)
- Basic assertion capabilities
- Platform standardization (windows has been the only implementation so far)
- Application layer code for user friendliness
